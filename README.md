## Task

Create a flexible tooltip using React that displays when hovering over the following three elements: a button, some text, and an icon.

You can use any text and icon that you'd like. The tooltip's content should support these two cases:
- simple text
- an image and text

Please send your solution via github link. Including a working demo is a plus.
